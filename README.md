## Overview
The credit risk classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to assess the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on 
loans, a critical challenge in the finance industry. By leveraging historical financial data, the project aims to classify borrowers into risk 
categories, enabling lenders to make informed decisions and mitigate potential losses. My interest in this project stems from a passion for 
solving complex problems in finance, particularly in doing data analysis to generate insights and predictive modeling to uncover future trends. The project not 
only aligns with my goal of applying data science to real-world financial challenges but also offers an opportunity to explore innovative solutions 
that can improve credit risk management. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, 
seaborn, plotly, sci-kit learn, and xgboost for data processing, manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## Problem Statement
The finance industry faces significant challenges in accurately assessing credit risk, as traditional methods of assessing a borrower often 
rely on limited or outdated criteria, leading to suboptimal lending decisions. By improving the accuracy of credit risk assessment, the project aims to optimize decision-making for 
lenders, reduce default rates, and understand which variables contribute most heavily to a borrowers' creditworthiness.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of data science:

1. **Data Collection/Cleaning:** Reading historical credit data into dataframe and cleaning to make sure dataset is suitable for initial analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing data analysis to understand the data distribution, identify trends, and generate insights. Creating visual representations of the data to better understand relationships between variables. 

4. **Pre-Processing:** Performing feature engineering, feature selection, binning, encoding and scaling relevant features to optimize classification outcomes and ensure data consistency. 
   
5. **Model Building:** Applying algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest classifier, and xgboost to train and test the data. 

6. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing metrics between models and assessing which one to use for future use.
